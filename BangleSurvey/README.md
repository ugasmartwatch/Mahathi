WBDASHBOARD FILE:

- creates a file that gets realtime updates of components like battery, light, temperature, and more from the Puck.js
 and sends it to display the recent data onto this dashboard website.
 - GOAL: to use this as a dashboard for PARENTS to monitor the data (battery, temperature) to appropriately notify the children 
of the status of their watch and send reminders/ surveys as needed after monitoring data.


NotifySurvey FILE: 
- This file consists of the commands of a test of how to send a full screen reminder popup to the Bangle watch 
- GOALS (2/07/23): 
        - to complete the file so that a full survey pops up onto the bangle watch
        -  to complete a TIMED survey that pops up at certain times asking appropriate questions according to time of day
- I am  working on notifySurvey which is the JS code of how to format reminders and send a lunch reminder to a kid's watch.
- By manipulating and using the notify library I was able to keep up a reminder(message) format without it disappearing after a short second. 
- GOALS (2/14/23):
         - Find a way to change screen from NOTIFICATION screen by swipe up/down/left/right. Currently, the notification screen remains and does not   disappear upon swiping.
         
        
ParentalRemindPlatform FILE:
- ParentalRemindPlatform folder, where I created a test.html file of a static UI. It is a platform where parents can send default or custom reminders to their children's watches.
